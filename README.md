## For the good functionality of the script, the following tools must be installed correctly:


- [x] subfinder
- [x] gau
- [x] aquatone
- [x] subzy
- [x] dnsenum
- [x] enum4linux
- [x] nmapAutomator
- [x] gf
- [x] Gobuster
- [x] httpx




 ## To run and install the script, use the following command:
                          
git clone https://github.com/yamotoz/Killing_hearts
cd Killing_hearts
chmod +x Killing _Hearts.sh

Simple usage:

bash Killing_hearts.sh folder_name link(without https) IP  -all/-ALL;




note1: if you do not have the necessary scripts, type at the END of the command -all or -ALL to download and run them.

note2: The installation of some tools will be in the root, so I recommend
that you use the script there too.
