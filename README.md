## Killing hearts
It's a dedicated script for **analyzing the website** in question and assessing **subdomain takeover**, with its primary function being site recognition. If you wish to conduct a vulnerability analysis, take a look at<a style="color: grey" href="https://github.com/yamotoz/Angel_Azazel"><b> Angel Azazel</b></a>.

## For the good functionality of the script, the following tools must be installed correctly:


- [x] subfinder
- [x] gau
- [x] aquatone
- [x] subzy
- [x] dnsenum
- [x] enum4linux
- [x] nmapAutomator
- [x] gf
- [x] Gobuster
- [x] httpx




 ## To run and install the script, use the following command:
```bash                          
git clone https://github.com/yamotoz/Killing_hearts
```
```bash
cd Killing_hearts
```
```bash
chmod +x Killing _Hearts.sh
```


## Simple usage:

```bash
bash Killing_hearts.sh folder_name link(without https) IP  -all/-ALL;
```



Note: if you do not have the necessary scripts, type at the END of the command -all or -ALL to download and run them.


Note: The installation of some tools will be in the root, so I recommend
that you use the script there too.
